# DPM

Currently supports only very [basic configuration described in documentation](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/DPM/DpmSetupManualInstallation#Note_on_OpenID_Connect_and_WLCG)

:exclamation: [DPM EOL / end of support](https://indico.cern.ch/event/813745/contributions/3766117/note/) comes in summer 2024 (CentOS7/CentOS8 EOL) and it was decided not to fix issues with current WLCG JWT token implementation. If you would like to use WLCG JWT tokens in production that you can easily and quicly [migrate to dCache](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/DPM/DpmDCache).
