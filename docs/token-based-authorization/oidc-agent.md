# OIDC Agent 

[oidc-agent](https://github.com/indigo-dc/oidc-agent) is a set of tools to get and manage OpenID Connect tokens and make them easily usable from the command line. It follows the ```ssh-agent``` design, so users can handle OIDC tokens in a similar way as they do with ssh keys.

## **Installation instructions**

### **Quick CENTOS7 installation recipe**

Current releases are available at [the KIT Repo Server](https://repo.data.kit.edu)

This recipe shows how to quickly install ```oidc-agent``` on CENTOS 7.

```
$ VERSION=$(curl --silent "https://api.github.com/repos/indigo-dc/oidc-agent/releases/latest" | grep -Po '"tag_name": "v\K.*?(?=")') '"tag_name": "v\K.*?(?=")'

$ yum -y install epel-release

$ yum -y install https://repo.data.kit.edu/centos/centos7/oidc-agent-$VERSION.el7.x86_64.rpm
```

Note: oidc-agent is supported on other OSes, including Debian/Ubuntu, SuSE, MacOS and Windows.

### **Bootstrapping oidc-agent**

The first thing to do is to start oidc-agent. This can be done issuing the following command:

```
$ eval $(oidc-agent)
Agent pid 62088
```

* ***To install OIDC Agent from source or in a Debian/Ubuntu distro, please refer to oidc-agent [installation documentation](https://indigo-dc.gitbook.io/oidc-agent/installation/install)***

## **How to register a client** 

In order to obtain a token out of IAM, a user needs a client registered. oidc-agent can automate this step and store client credentials securely on the user machine.

A new client can be registered using the ```oidc-gen``` command, as follows:

```
$ oidc-gen --pub --iss https://wlcg.cloud.cnaf.infn.it --scope max --flow=device  wlcg
```
The ```--flow=device``` instructs ```oidc-agent``` to use the device code flow for the authentication, which is the recommended way with IAM.

oidc-agent will register a new client and store the client credentials and a refresh token locally in encrypted form (the agent will ask for a password from the user).

## **How to print a list of all configured account** 

To obtain a list of all configured accounts configured, either ```oidc-gen --accounts``` or ```oidc-add --list``` can be used. Both of them can use the same flag ```-l```

```
$ oidc-gen -l
The following account configurations are usable: 
wlcg
```

## **How to print a client description** 

Printing the full client decrypted content can be done by passing the account shortname or the absolute filepath of the account, with ```oidc-gen --print``` or simply the ```-p``` flag


```
$ oidc-gen -p wlcg
Enter decryption password for account config 'wlcg':

}
```

## **How to get a token from oidc-agent** 

Tokens can be obtained using the ```oidc-token``` command, as follows:

```
oidc-token wlcg
```

This will request a token with all the scopes requested at client registration time. 

### **Limiting issued scopes** 

To limit the scopes included in the token, the ```-s``` flag can be used, as follows:

```
oidc-token -s storage.read:/ wlcg
```

In this example the scopes is being limited to ```storage.read:/```

### **Limiting token audience** 

The token audience can be limited using the ```--aud``` flag,

```
oidc-token --aud example.audience -s storage.read:/ wlcg
```

In this example the audience is being defined as ```example.audience```
